# melee-frame-data-mern-app

## General Assembly Project 3 Mern Stack

**This project is for somone looking to take over and host.**

### Mission:
I wanted to create a site that could show all Character Frame Data in Melee this application once all data is added will make it very easy for anyone to look up any frame data on one site.

### Target User:
The application created is used to rank all Characters from Super Smash Bros Melee on tier list when a specific character is clicked it brings up all information about their hitboxes and frame data. 
As of right now the project is deployed to heroku and will have example data with more being loaded in eventually.
A user is able to view a gif for most moves and is recommended to be hosted on imgur.

### Technologies Used:
